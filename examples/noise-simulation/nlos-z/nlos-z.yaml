# TAL v0.10.3 NLOS scene description file: https://github.com/diegoroyo/tal
# Created on 2023/11/28 with experiment name "nlos-z"

# TAL uses YAML files to configure everything in the NLOS setup:
# 1) Parameters for the light transport simulation that will be
#    executed using Transient Mitsuba 3 (see section labeled as "Mitsuba")
# 2) Laser and sensor position, and where they are pointed towards
#    (see section labeled as "Laser and sensor")
# 3) Geometry of the scene (visible or hidden): its location, materials, etc.
#    (see sections labeled as "Geometry", "Relay wall" and "Materials reference")

# This is the YAML file that you would get if you executed the command
# "tal render new nlos-z" on your shell.

# Basically, this file specifies different properties under YAML format.
# For example:
name: nlos-z
# this sets the parameter "name" of the scene as "nlos-z"

# Note: when you generate a YAML file, you will see that many parameters
# are commented. When you see this written:
#parameter: value
# It means that the default value for "parameter" is "value", you need
# to uncomment that line and modify the value if you want to change it.

# Now for sections 1) 2) and 3)

# Laser and sensor
##
# single: The laser illuminates one point in the relay wall,
#         the sensor captures all points in the relay wall
# confocal: The laser illuminates one point in the relay wall,

#             on the relay wall

# The relay wall is divided into a 2D grid of uniformly sized regions
# which represent the pixels of the rendered image. This sets the number of
# subdivisions in the X and Y dimensions.
# The division depends on the UV coordinates of the mesh. E.g. if sensor_width
# and sensor_height are set to 2, it will have a grid of 2x2 pixels, where the
# top-left pixel goes from UV (0, 0) to UV (0.5, 0.5).
# It is important to use a "rectangle" relay wall for correct UV coordinates.

# these next four variables specify the scanned area of the relay wall
# they are in UV coordinates, where (0, 0) is the top-left corner and (1, 1) is the bottom-right corner
# by default they cover the whole relay wall i.e. (0, 0) to (1, 1)

# Geometry (valid for hidden geometry or relay wall)

# Some parameters are optional (displacement, rot_degrees)
geometry:
# This is an example to define a geometry element from a OBJ file
- name: Z
  description: >
    Hidden geometry of the scene
  # mesh type: obj should define the filename of the OBJ
  # where you specify the full or relative path to that OBJ

# Relay walls

# Define which of the elements in the "geometry" list should act as the relay wall
# We set the relay wall to the geometry named "relay wall"
